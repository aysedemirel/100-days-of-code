# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [aysedemirel]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 31, Sunday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D1 
I refactored the operating systems project on Github. [https://github.com/aysedemirel/Operating-Systems](https://github.com/aysedemirel/Operating-Systems)

### R1D2

 I refactored the same repository as yesterday and faced difficulty with Eclipse keys. I couldn't use shift+8 combination, so "(" punctuation was not usable. The solution for the problem is to go to "Windows>Preferences>General>Keys" and search "Shift+8", and unbind the command. After the operation, don't forget to restart Eclipse.

### R1D3

Refactoring finished for a project. The last status is on Github.  Please write to me with your opinions about the repo. Before refactoring, even I didn't understand what the project is doing. This time, I updated the readme file with more detail. I guess it is more readable than before.

### R1D4

Basic HTML and HTML5 challenge finished on freeCodeCamp. The next step is Basic CSS. Before starting to study with freeCodeCamp, I created a repository on Github to record my progress. I have a problem with the repository also. I don't know how I did this, but two branches in the repository are not related to the same history.

### R1D5

Basic CSS challenge progressed on freeCodeCamp. And the problem solved that faced with yesterday. I had two branches in a repository on github, and their history was different. So I couldn't merge them easily. There was an exception that says their base history is different. One branch is enough for me, so I deleted the unuseful branch. And I changed the default branch with what I need. Next time, I will take care of the history problem when I create a branch. I solved the problem by deleting it. Of course, there is a way to solve the problem with the command line. In merging progress, you can handle the problem. I found the stackoverflow link. [Solution](https://t.co/DnMqy8eHPn?amp=1)

### R1D6

Basic CSS challenge finished on FreeCodeCamp. There was an example in FreeCodeCamp, and I improved it. My version is penguin family, and it is on my Github account. Coding the penguin family was a bundle of fun for me.

### R1D7

Applied Virtual Design challenge started and progress on freeCodeCamp. Nearly it is done!

### R1D8

Today was Udacity day for me. I am a participant in the "Bertelsmann Scholarship - Introduction to AI in Business" on Udacity. Create a Medical Image Annotation Job Project finished.

### R1D9

I learned amazing things about CSS and finished the Applied Visual Design challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Also, I started to Build a model lesson on Udacity. Training and evaluating a model is the next step for me. 

### R1D10

I designed my little project about freeCodeCamp status. I plan to use everything that I learned about web programming (I know my knowledge is too limited yet. I started to code it, but couldn't finish.

### R1D11

The little project where I used everything I learned about web programming is over. Continue learning with FreeCodeCamp. I started learning Applied Accessibility. Half of it finished.

### R1D12

I made a to-do list before starting daily progress, I think it motivated me. After that, I'm going to make a to-do list for two days in the 100DaysOfCode challenge.

### R1D13

FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Principles, Kodluyoruz: Contribution, start to solve "HackerRank: Java Regex"

### R1D14

Regex challenge solved from HackerRank.  Now I can detect all fake IPs with the regex pattern. ~ I learned amazing things about CSS flexbox. ~ I finished all the interactive parts for the Responsive Web Design challenge at freeCodeCamp. Time to work on some projects.

### R1D15

Today, I studied AI Udacity and have started to solve the "Java-Valid Username Regular Expression" problem Hackerrank. And reading a lot.

### R1D16

Today, I got my 5th star for Java at HackerRank I solved two problems: Big integer and username validator.

### R1D17

Today, I have started the tribute page project for freeCodeCamp. The project is to show my respect for Atat√ºrk. In our hearts...

### R1D18

I have coded the tribute page. Now I have a template(I used lorem ipsum, info will come later), and I need to make it fancier. Time is CSS time.

### R1D19

Today was my lazy day. I was able to study too little outside of my daily work routine. In detail, I've worked on vectors and array-lists. Tomorrow will be better.

### R1D20

Tribute Page is nearly done. I need to review the id and user stories. Also, I want to add a scroll-up button.

### R1D21

Today, I finished the tribute page project freeCodeCamp. I moved on to the second project to solve: "Build a Survey Form".

### R1D22

Today, I finished Phase-1 "Bertelsmann Scholarship - Introduction to AI in Business" from Udacity. It was a great journey, and I learned a lot of valuable knowledge. I hope I can get a chance to be a participant in the full nanodegree.  Also, I refactored my 100DaysOfCode repo from Github. Now I have a backlog and complete list. And I started to solve Java Regex 2 problem at HackerRank.

### R1D23

I started the "Scientific Computing with Python" course from FreeCodeCamp. My first goal is to remember my python knowledge and then learn more. 

### R1D24

Anaconda installation: Today, I dealt with Anaconda installation. My OS is Windows  10, and I decided to use Anaconda IDE for Python works. I guessed it would be easy, just next next next. But it didn't happen.  After installing the Anaconda, I couldn't open Anaconda-Navigator. So I solved the problem with the command line. 

### R1D25

Reading...  A clear and great source to start understanding neural networks. https://cezannec.github.io/Intro_Neural_Networks/

### R1D26

I studied Python and progressed on the 'Scientific Computing With Python' course. I guess I will finish the interactive part this weekend.  Jupyter notebook is used for progress. It is good to work with small code pieces.  

### R1D27

I studied Python and progressed on the 'Scientific Computing With Python' course. I guess I will finish the interactive part this weekend.  Jupyter notebook is used for progress. It is good to work with small code pieces.  

### R1D28

Today, I continued to study Python, progressing on the 'Scientific Computing With Python' course. I've collected all my code snippets in a GitHub repository.  I used Spyder IDE today. I need to work on the IDE more. Also, I started to code the second project for FreeCodeCamp-Responsive Web Design: Survey Form. I opened a GitHub repository for it.

### R1D29

I finished the survey form project and pushed it on GitHub. Now it has only the front-end side. After I learned the back-end side, I will put the form on my website to see the suggestions.

### R1D30

I finished the network part of the Python course from FreeCodeCamp. And I started coding the "Product Landing Page" project, and the product that I will promote is: "Kolonya"

### R1D31

Today is not a very productive day. I coded the basic HTML structure for the Kolonya-Product-Landing project.

### R1D32

I designed prototype-1 for the Kolonya product landing project. I used the "Justinmind" program to design. I think it is useful to see the result before coding. Designing and coding are in prototype-1.  I need to make the project more lovely.

### R1D33

I designed prototype-1 for the Kolonya product landing project. I used the "Justinmind" program to design. I think it is useful to see the result before coding. Designing and coding are in prototype-1.  I need to make the project more lovely.

### R1D34

I continued to code the Kolonya product landing project. I learned many things during the project coding and decided to share the knowledge as little notes on Twitter.

### R1D35

Completed the Pricing list for the Kolonya product landing project. 

### R1D36
