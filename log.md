### Day 2: February 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring

**Thoughts:** I refactored the same repository as yesterday and faced difficulty with Eclipse keys. I couldn't use shift+8 combination, so "(" punctuation was not usable. The solution for the problem is to go to "Windows>Preferences>General>Keys" and search "Shift+8", and unbind the command. After the operation, don't forget to restart Eclipse.

### Day 3: February 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring

**Thoughts:** Refactoring finished for a project. The last status is on Github.  Please write to me with your opinions about the repo. Before refactoring, even I didn't understand what the project is doing. This time, I updated the readme file with more detail. I guess it is more readable than before.

### Day 4: February 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp - Basic HTML and HTML5 

**Thoughts:** Basic HTML and HTML5 challenge finished on freeCodeCamp. The next step is Basic CSS. Before starting to study with freeCodeCamp, I created a repository on Github to record my progress. I have a problem with the repository also. I don't know how I did this, but two branches in the repository are not related to the same history.

### Day 5: February 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp - Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** Basic CSS challenge progressed on freeCodeCamp. And the problem solved that faced with yesterday. I had two branches in a repository on github, and their history was different. So I couldn't merge them easily. There was an exception that says their base history is different. One branch is enough for me, so I deleted the unuseful branch. And I changed the default branch with what I need. Next time, I will take care of the history problem when I create a branch. I solved the problem by deleting it. Of course, there is a way to solve the problem with the command line. In merging progress, you can handle the problem. I found the stackoverflow link.
